Since we're working with light fields captured with Lytro First Generation Camera, each ground truth sample will be a matrix of 10x10 pixels, and the downsampled ones will be a matrix of 5x5 pixels. Therefore, the model will be trained to augment an angular matrix of 5x5 pixels to an angular matrix of 10x10 pixels. Moreover, each sample will be treat as an image of 3 channels.\n"
